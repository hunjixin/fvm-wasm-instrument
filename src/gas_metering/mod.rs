/// Transforms a given module into one that charges gas for code to be executed by proxy of an
/// imported gas metering function.
///
/// The output module imports a mutable global i64 $GAS_COUNTER_NAME ("gas_couner") from the
/// specified module. The value specifies the amount of available units of gas. A new function
/// doing gas accounting using this global is added to the module. Having the accounting logic
/// in WASM lets us avoid the overhead of external calls.
///
/// The body of each function is divided into metered blocks, and the calls to charge gas are
/// inserted at the beginning of every such block of code. A metered block is defined so that,
/// unless there is a trap, either all of the instructions are executed or none are. These are
/// similar to basic blocks in a control flow graph, except that in some cases multiple basic
/// blocks can be merged into a single metered block. This is the case if any path through the
/// control flow graph containing one basic block also contains another.
///
/// Charging gas is at the beginning of each metered block ensures that 1) all instructions
/// executed are already paid for, 2) instructions that will not be executed are not charged for
/// unless execution traps, and 3) the number of calls to "gas" is minimized. The corollary is that
/// modules instrumented with this metering code may charge gas for instructions not executed in
/// the event of a trap.
///
/// Additionally, each `memory.grow` instruction found in the module is instrumented to first make
/// a call to charge gas for the additional pages requested. This cannot be done as part of the
/// block level gas charges as the gas cost is not static and depends on the stack argument to
/// `memory.grow`.
///
/// The above transformations are performed for every function body defined in the module. This
/// function also rewrites all function indices references by code, table elements, etc., since
/// the addition of an imported functions changes the indices of module-defined functions.
///
/// This routine runs in time linear in the size of the input module.
///
/// The function fails if the module contains any operation forbidden by gas rule set, returning
/// the original module as an Err. Importing Global values is currently forbidden.
